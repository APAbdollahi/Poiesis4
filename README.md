# Digital Poiesis Laboratory

An interactive agent-based modeling framework for exploring algorithmic influence on opinion dynamics.

## Overview

The Digital Poiesis Laboratory is a "flight simulator" for digital policy, providing a transparent and auditable environment to investigate the consequences of platform design and strategic interventions. This implementation accompanies the research paper "The Digital Poiesis Laboratory: An Agent-Based Model for Exploring Algorithmic Influence on Opinion Dynamics."

## Recent Updates (Bug Fixes)

This version includes critical bug fixes that improve the accuracy and functionality of the simulation:

### Major Fixes

1. **Engagement System Now Functional** ‚úÖ
   - Agents now properly like/dislike content based on belief alignment
   - Virality scores are calculated correctly from engagement
   - Influence scores update based on actual engagement metrics

2. **Defensive Campaign Radicalization** ‚úÖ
   - The "Radicalize Majority" slider now properly fuses identities
   - Majority camp agents can be made resistant to opinion change

3. **Improved Cosine Similarity Calculation** ‚úÖ
   - Added `safe_cosine_similarity()` function to handle edge cases
   - Prevents NaN values from zero vectors
   - More numerically stable

4. **Influence Score Updates Fixed** ‚úÖ
   - Now counts engagement from current cycle only (not all-time)
   - Uses exponential decay for more realistic dynamics
   - Prevents unbounded score growth

5. **Perception Gap Calculation Improved** ‚úÖ
   - Uses windowed exposure history (last 100 items)
   - Prevents memory issues in long simulations
   - More accurate reflection of recent experience

6. **Feed Composition Fixed** ‚úÖ
   - Backfills with discovery content when follower feed is sparse
   - Ensures agents always see a full feed

7. **Missing Import Added** ‚úÖ
   - Added `plotly.graph_objects` import to Post-Mortem Analysis page
   - Fixed A/B testing visualization

8. **Deprecated API Calls Updated** ‚úÖ
   - Changed `st.experimental_rerun()` to `st.rerun()`

Adjust algorithm weights (personalization, virality, influence)
Click "Launch Campaign"


###Analyze Results (Page 3)

View final belief distribution
Examine perception gaps (reality distortion)
Drill down into individual agent experiences
Compare multiple runs using A/B testing

Model Architecture
Core Components

##Agents

Belief vectors in 2D opinion space [-1, 1]¬≤
Psychology: learning rate, conviction, identity fusion
Platform profile: inferred beliefs, influence score
Attention budget and exposure history


##Content

Topic vectors in shared belief space
Creator and timestamp
Engagement metrics (likes, dislikes, shares)


##Social Graph

Directed network (follows)
Homophily-driven generation
Static structure (dynamic networks in future work)


##Hybrid Feed Algorithm

Weighted scoring: personalization + virality + influence
Targeted amplification (Œ≤_amp) for non-neutral governance
Configurable discovery/follower content ratio



##Key Equations
Belief Update (Equation 2 from paper):
B[i, t+1] = B[i,t] + (Œª_i / Œ∫_i) * (C_c - B[i,t])
Where:

Œª_i = learning rate
Œ∫_i = conviction (resistance to change)
C_c = content topic vector

Feed Scoring (Equation 1 from paper):
Score(C) = w_pers * S_pers + w_viral * S_viral + w_influ * S_influ + Œ≤_amp * Sim(C, T)
Platform Archetypes
Facebook-like (The Social Graph)

High personalization (w_pers = 0.8)
Low discovery ratio (20%)
Tight homophily (threshold = 0.4)
Effect: Slow-forming echo chambers, high segregation

X-like (The Town Square)

High virality (w_viral = 0.6)
High discovery ratio (50%)
Loose homophily (threshold = 0.7)
Effect: Volatile dynamics, ideological firefights

###Campaign Types
Offensive Campaign
Goal: Flip majority opinion from Camp A to Camp B
Tactics:

üéØ Targeted Amplification (Œ≤_amp > 0): Boost minority content
ü§ñ Bot Networks: Inject artificial agents posting minority views
üëë Kingmaker Effect: Amplify influence of aligned creators

Success Metric: Final majority support < 50%
Defensive Campaign
Goal: Prevent majority erosion
Tactics:

üõ°Ô∏è Algorithmic Suppression (Œ≤_amp < 0): Suppress minority content
üß† Radicalize Majority: Fuse identities (make resistant to change)
No bots needed (defensive posture)

Success Metric: Final support > Initial support - 5%
Key Metrics
Opinion Metrics

Pct in Majority Camp: % of agents closer to majority opinion vector
Polarization: Variance of belief distributions

###Distortion Metrics

Reality Distortion Index: Average perception gap across agents
Perception Gap: ||Agent's belief - Average content seen||

###Network Metrics

Assortativity: Degree to which similar agents are connected
Network density: Number of edges relative to possible edges

###Configuration Files
Platform configurations are JSON files in the configs/ directory. Each includes:
json{
  "platform_name": "Platform Name",
  "description": "Description of archetype",
  "engine_settings": {
    "algorithm_class": "HybridFeedAlgorithm"
  },
  "world_generator": {
    "population_config": {...},
    "network_config": {...}
  },
  "algorithm_params": {
    "discovery_feed_ratio": 0.2,
    "weights": {
      "w_personalization": 1.0,
      "w_virality": 1.0,
      "w_influence": 1.0
    }
  },
  "agent_psychology": {
    "learning_rate": 0.01,
    "identity_fusion_pct": 0.1,
    "posting_propensity": 0.1,
    ...
  }
}
###Creating Custom Archetypes

Copy an existing config file
Modify parameters to reflect your platform design
Save in configs/ directory with .json extension
Restart the app to load new archetype

###Known Limitations
As documented in the paper (Section 6):

Simplified Agent Psychology: No confirmation bias, backfire effects, or motivated reasoning
Static Networks: No dynamic link formation/deletion
Abstract Content: No topic modeling, media types, or veracity
No Empirical Calibration: Parameters are conceptually grounded but not fitted to real data

###Future Work

 Dynamic network co-evolution
 Richer cognitive biases (confirmation bias, backfire effect)
 Multi-topic content with veracity modeling
 Empirical calibration against real platform data
 Multi-platform interactions
 Temporal attention dynamics

Technical Notes
Performance

Recommended: 100-300 agents for interactive use
Experiment Designer: Uses 150 agents for faster sweeps
Typical run time: 30 cycles with 200 agents ‚âà 10-20 seconds

Memory Management

Content accumulates in all_content dict
For very long simulations (>200 cycles), consider clearing old content
Exposure logs are unbounded but windowed for metrics (last 100 items)

Randomness

All randomness is controlled by master_seed
Same seed = reproducible results
Leave seed blank for different outcomes each run
